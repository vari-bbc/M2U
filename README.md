# M2U

This program takes either the output from the QUINT workflow or a specific file format and allows you to create two types of heatmaps that can be used to display the data or to QC the data for further analysis. One heatmap is a normal rectangular heatmap while the other is an anatomical heatmap which displays data on top of a mouse brain outline (outline from the Alan Brain Atlas). There are a couple output files throughout the app to save your spot for easy return as well as easy download of the heatmaps and data behind them. The app is hosted at: https://vai-bbc.shinyapps.io/Mouse_to_Usable_M2U/.
